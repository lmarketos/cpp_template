# cpp_template
Sample project with build and unit test support. Self-contained environment for building/testing through the use of a build environment docker.

Intended to be cloned or used as a template for a starting point for home C++ projects.

The host system only needs git and docker to use this. It can optionally use clang-format in a pre-commit git hook.

## Getting started
From the root directory of the repo:

Build the docker image used to compile the application and run analysis tools
**This command must run successfully before any of the other commands will work**
```
./dev build_docker
./dev build_custom_docker
```
Build the sample application. Note that the docker mounts the root dir of the repo so files are never copied into the build docker. You can edit your source locally in the repo
```
./dev build
```
Run a bash shell in the build docker
```
./dev shell
```
Run the sample application (probably needs to be run from the docker shell vs the host shell)f
```
./bin/HelloWorld
```    
For a complete list of options
```
./dev -h
```
## To Do
